# AWS Cost Analysis Tool

## Overview
This tool provides comprehensive analysis of AWS spending patterns across multiple accounts and services. It generates detailed reports and visualizations to help identify cost optimization opportunities, spending anomalies, and usage patterns.

## Features

### 1. Multi-dimensional Analysis
- **Domain Summary**: Service-wise spending breakdown and patterns
- **Account Comparison**: Cross-account spending analysis
- **Monthly Trends**: Temporal spending patterns
- **Detailed Analysis**: In-depth service usage patterns
- **Cumulative Analysis**: Consolidated view across all dimensions

### 2. Key Analytics
- Service domain categorization
- Spending pattern detection
- Anomaly identification
- Risk assessment
- Trend analysis
- Cost distribution analysis

### 3. Automated Reporting
- Excel-based reports with multiple worksheets
- Conditional formatting for easy visualization
- Automated highlighting of significant variations
- Comprehensive summary statistics

## Prerequisites
```python
pip install pandas numpy openpyxl
```

## Input File Format
The tool expects an Excel file named `MyPodData.xlsx` with the following structure:
- Multiple sheets (one per AWS account)
- Each sheet should contain:
  - Service names in the first column
  - Monthly costs in subsequent columns
  - 12-month total cost column

## Usage

1. **Prepare Input Data**
   - Place your AWS cost data in `MyPodData.xlsx`
   - Ensure proper formatting of input data

2. **Run the Script**
   ```python
   python aws_cost_analysis.py
   ```

3. **Output**
   The tool generates `AWS_Complete_Spend_Analysis.xlsx` containing:
   - Domain Summary
   - Account Comparison
   - Monthly Trends
   - Detailed Analysis
   - Cumulative Analysis

## Output Details

### 1. Domain Summary
- Overall service domain spending overview
- Domain-wise total and average spend
- Account distribution across domains

### 2. Account Comparison
- Account-level spending patterns
- Domain concentration analysis
- Month-over-month changes

### 3. Monthly Trends
- Monthly spending patterns
- Seasonal variations
- Growth trends

### 4. Detailed Analysis
- Comprehensive spending analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Risk assessment

### 5. Cumulative Analysis
- Cross-domain comparisons
- Account spending distributions
- Domain utilization patterns

## Excel Report Formatting

The generated Excel report includes:
- Conditional formatting for easy identification of:
  - High-risk areas (Red)
  - Medium-risk areas (Orange)
  - Positive variations (Green)
  - Negative variations (Light Red)
- Frozen header rows
- Auto-filtered columns
- Auto-adjusted column widths
- Formatted currency values
- Percentage representations

## Key Metrics

1. **Risk Assessment**
   - High/Medium/Low risk categorization
   - Volatility measurement
   - Anomaly detection

2. **Spending Patterns**
   - Month-over-month changes
   - Service concentration
   - Domain distribution

3. **Variance Analysis**
   - Deviation from averages
   - Spending spikes
   - Unusual patterns

## Error Handling

The tool includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Missing input file
- Invalid data formats
- Calculation errors
- Empty data sets

## Customization

The tool can be customized by modifying:
1. Service domain mappings in `get_service_domains()`
2. Risk thresholds in `calculate_risk_level()`
3. Formatting styles in `format_excel_with_highlights()`
